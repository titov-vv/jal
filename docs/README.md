## üì• Installation
JAL offers cross-platform compatibility and portability. Here's how to get started:
1. **From GitHub Repository**:
   - Clone repository locally with `git https://github.com/titov-vv/jal.git`
   - Ensure you have Python 3.8.1 or later and meet all dependencies in `requirements.txt`.
   - Tips Windows users: Ensure Python installation from ![the official site](https://www.python.org/) and turn on options `pip installation` and `add Python to environment variables` during the installation. Reboot to apply changes.
   - Use `run.py` to launch the application.
2. **Using pip**:
   - Install using `pip install jal`.
   - Launch with the `jal` command or alternatively `python -m jal.jal`.
3. **Hybrid Installation**:
   - Download source files and use `setup.py` for tailored installation.
  

Database will be initialized automatically with minimal required set of data, and you will be able to start use the program.

You may choose program language in menu *Languages*.

## üîß Configuration
JAL configuration is stored in `jal.sqlite` file together with all other data, that is created by default in `jal` folder.
But you may configure location of this file with help of `database_path` parameter in `jal.ini` located in OS config directory (e.g. `$HOME/.config` on most Unix-like systems). 
Here is an example of such file:
```jal.ini
[main]
database_path=/home/user/some_folder
```

## ‚ùóÔ∏è Upgrades
If you installed *jal* via *pip* then you may upgrade it to newer version with help of command `pip install jal -U`

## üñ≠  Backups
You can use menu *Data->Backup* and *Data->Restore* to save and restore a copy of your data.
But you may get the same result by simply saving *jal.sqlite* file that contains everything.
You may see a location of the file that *jal* uses in menu *About*.

## üìà Tax report for investment account
Tax report can be prepared based on data from any broker if operations are present in JAL. Tax reports are supported for Russia and Portugal.    
You can import operations from broker statement with help of menu *Import->Statement*.  
Step-by-step example (in russian language) of Russian tax report preparation for Interactive Brokers can be found on [this page](https://github.com/titov-vv/jal/blob/master/docs/ru-tax-3ndfl/taxes.md). 
Use contacts from beginning of this page if you need support regarding statements or reports.
